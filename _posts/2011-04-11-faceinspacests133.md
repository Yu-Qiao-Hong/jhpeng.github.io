This certifies that the face of **JiaHong Peng** has flown in space
aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery on mission STS-133 from February 24 -
March 9, 2011. The face was flown on Discovery's mission to the
International Space Station at an altitude of 220 miles above the Earth.
It flew at a speed of more than 17,400 miles per hour as it orbited our
planet. We were glad to have you aboard!  
In 30 years of missions, the Space Shuttle Program has enabled space
flight to grow from brief forays of exploration to the permanent human
presence in orbit today. The shuttle has made complex robotics,
intricate spacewalks and precision flight in orbit seem commonplace. It
has launched more people to orbit than any spacecraft, and its crews
have opened the frontier of space to nations around the world. Through
triumph and tragedy, the shuttle has demonstrated the perseverance of
America, and the dedication of the team that has made it possible.  
The success of the Space Shuttle Program is a result of the
contributions of your dedicated and diligent support to NASA. Thank you
for your devotion and your efforts which directly contributed to the
Program’s amazing accomplishments!
